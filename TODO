Todo - code:
  ✔ Handle the exception when there are non image files in the selected image directory. @done(18-09-19 13:41)
  ✔ Add option to display annotations in a separate window inside the app. @done(17-09-19 12:58)
  ✔ Improve the design of the "edit annotations file" popup window. @done(17-09-19 14:52s)
  ✘ Move the config file away from the users view. @cancelled(17-09-19 13:26)
      The config file will stay in the main directory of the project. There is no reason to store it somwhere else.
  ☐ Write docstrings.
  ✔ Clear entry field when a new annotations file is created. @done(17-09-19 13:22)
  ✔ Diable the main window hiding when selecting the images directory. @done(17-09-19 14:05)
  ✔ Change the size of the preview size control popup window. @done(17-09-19 14:08)
  ✔ Fix the bug that makes it impossible to change the file selection in the menu after adding or removing a file. @done(18-09-19 13:53)
  ✔ Fix saving new class names - they are shown correctly in the app but saved to the annotations file as 'class1', 'class2' etc. @done(18-09-19 10:50)
  ✔ Fix the behaviuor of the text widged when expanding the annotations preview window. @done(18-09-19 11:05)
  ✔ Annotations preview text widged does not scale horizontaly to the text and/or window size - check if that can be changed or add a scrollbar. @done(18-09-19 17:52)
      Added scrollbars.
  ✔ Fix the process of creation new empty annotations file when there are no files in the data directory. @done(18-09-19 11:16)
      It leads to the bug with the `self.annotations_file` and `self.selected_annotations_file`.
  ✔ Fix the conflict between `self.annotations_file` and `self.selected_annotations_file`. @done(18-09-19 11:32)
      Right now there can be conflicts when it comes to saving annotations when the app is restarted with only a custom annoations file.
      If the app is restarted with only a custom file it will try to save the annotations to the `annotations.csv` even though it does not exist.
  ✔ Check if `set_annotations_file()` is obsolete. If so, remove it and the `Set as active` button. @done(18-09-19 14:17)
      It became obsolete after introducing `self.active_annotations_file`.
  ✔ Check if changing the annotations file to preview causes the following annoations to be saved in the last previewed file. Fix it if so. @created(18-09-19 13:59) @done(18-09-19 14:12)
      It did, a new variable had to be introduced - `self.annotations_file_to_preview`.

Todo - repo:
  ✔ Update README. @done(18-09-19 13:28)
